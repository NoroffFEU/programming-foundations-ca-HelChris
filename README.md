# Programming Foundations CA

Course Assignment in programming Foundations.

In this CA I've done my best to make use of the basics within the programming language Javascript to describe an everyday object. The everyday object I've chosen is a bookshelf with "books" on the shelfs. In the process I've learnt to use the following property types:

- String -> "used to declare author, material, publisher etc."
- Number -> used to declare dimensions, pages, publication year etc.
- Boolean -> the true/false used to state that the bookshelf is assembled, that the bookshelf indeed contains a number of books, if the book is on the shelf or not.
- Array -> the book objects stated in the code is my array of objects.
- Function -> added functions to add or remove books, get the total number of books and retrive the price of all the books.

The object and its properties is as follows,

--------The Bookshelf--------
material: wood,
color: brown,

dimensions (in cm):
width: 200,
height: 150,
depth: 60

configurations:
number of shelves: 4,
assembled: true,
empty: false

books stored on the shelf:
six books: books 1-6.

--------The Books--------
There are a total of six books, they all have these properties: title, author, published (date), publisher, genre, pages, price, currency, onShelf, language.
The value of these properties varies from book to book, but they all share the same author, currency and language.

---

Additional features:

I've added some CSS and HTML to create a visual of the bookshelf stated in the JS,
added script in HTML to retrive some of the information about the books to the "bookshelf",
used ID to retrive the list of the books.
