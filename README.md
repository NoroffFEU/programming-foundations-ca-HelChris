In this CA I've done my best to make use of the basics within the programming language Javascript to describe an everyday object. The everyday object I've chosen is a bookshelf with books on the shelfs. In the process I've learnt to use the following property types:

- String -> "used to declare author, material, publisher etc."
- Number -> used to declare dimensions, pages, publication year etc.
- Boolean -> the true/false used to state that the bookshelf is assembled and that the bookshelf indeed contain a number of books.
- Array -> the book objects stated in the code is my array of objects.
- Function -> added functions to add or remove books, get the total number of books and retrive the price of all the books.

The object and its properties is as follows,

--------The Bookshelf--------
material: wood,
color: brown,

dimensions (in cm):
width: 200,
height: 150,
depth: 60

configurations:
number of shelves: 4,
assembled: true,
empty: false

books stored on the shelf:
six books: books 1-6.

--------The Books--------
There are a total of six books, they all have these properties: title, author, published (date), publisher, genre, pages, prive, currency, available, language.
The value of these properties varies from book to book, but they all share the same author, currency, language and availability.

---

Additional features:

I've added some CSS and HTML to create a visual of the bookshelf stated in the JS.
